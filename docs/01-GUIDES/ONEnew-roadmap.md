# ONEnew - Let's Build This Thing

**Goal**: Fresh Studio1 with all OOPS innovations, built clean from the start

## üö® AGENT RULES - MUST FOLLOW

1. **ASK FIRST** - Always get permission before creating/changing code
2. **SIMPLE DOCS** - No fluff, metrics, or walls of text
3. **USER LEADS** - Follow their direction, don't assume
4. **ASK NAMES** - Always ask what to name things (likes ALL CAPS folders)
5. **DELETE, DON'T COMMENT** - Remove code completely
6. **NO HARDCODING** - Everything must be dynamic
7. **GRID ONLY** - CSS Grid with a-z areas, NEVER flexbox
8. **ARCHITECTURE HIERARCHY** - Try in this order:
   - ONEconnect first (theme-driven features)
   - ONEstore second (shared state/logic)
   - Utils third (pure functions only)
   - App.tsx last resort (initialization only)

## Where We Are Now

‚úÖ **Documentation Phase Complete**
- All major components documented
- Innovations captured (Loop, Auto Grid, ONEconnect)
- Utils audited
- Ready to build

---

## What We're Building

**ONE** = Clean, modular visual builder with:
- ONEstore (single source of truth)
- ONEconnect (magic component wiring)
- Pure CSS Grid (a-z auto areas)
- Loop pattern (universal UI components)

---

## Build Order (Simple ‚Üí Complex)

### Step 1: Foundation
- [X] Create ONEstore
- [X] Basic App.tsx setup
- [X] Verify store connection

### Step 2: Core Systems
- [ ] ONEconnect
- [ ] Auto Grid utility
- [ ] Theme processor
- [ ] Remove test code:
  - `/src/App.tsx` - Replace test UI with real app
  - `/src/App.css` - Replace with theme styles
  - Keep `/src/index.css` - Just global resets

### Step 3: First Components
- [ ] Loop & LoopItem
- [ ] Icon component
- [ ] Test with layout switcher

### Step 4: Expand
- [ ] More components as needed
- [ ] Follow the patterns
- [ ] Keep it simple

### Step 5: Missing Systems (Add if Needed)
- [ ] Error Boundaries (important for production)
- [ ] Custom hooks folder (for shared logic)
- [ ] Router (only if multi-page needed)
- [ ] API service layer (if R2Manager not enough)

## Key Patterns to Use

1. **ONEstore** - 3 actors (Designer, Workspace, Projects)
2. **Auto Grid** - Everything uses CSS Grid with a-z areas
3. **Loop Pattern** - One component for all lists/toolbars
4. **Direct Store Access** - No props, no events

---

## Next Action

**Create ONEstore** - The heart of everything

*Simple plan. Clear path. Let's go.*
