# App.tsx

Notes: 
1. should it be themes ui and one? 
2. Component Registery- empty, are we accounting for the auto registration feature that i blieve the ONEconnect provides here, because i think that is how we had it setup but we should evaluate this because if we want to create virtual components maybe we dont want to register every single one and maybe we should register it directly?? lets add this note and information to our current uiONEelement whiteboard right? 
3. on Renders can you verify what it is wrapping in ui? because i was under the impression all this time that the theme processor setup the scoping for teh ui and one theme and I think now wigh our current steup all we need to scope is the base variables in each them with ui or one and then just use the base ui or one elment in either theme as the types in the structure. when i mentioned adding ui to the react component like the ONE element it was this scope i was referring to. we just need to add the type ui to the react componets because they are technicaly structure right? so i ust want to clarify what this specific line item is referencing.  

Also on that note, the way we crurrently have thigs setup our intension has been to import the react components into the ui theme and wrap them in a pre scoped wrapper target the root of the react component and then target each element with presets from the ui theme (removing all actual styling from the esisting react components, making them dynamic and much lighter). 

However this new direction we are exploring is looking at teh possibility of creating one single element react component that has a single ui element (scoped to all 100+base pre-applied variables) and pre set with all of the various prop targets etc compleetly dry ready for hydration via the ui theme through a communiction between the ONEconnect (OC) and the uiONE element to hydrate a virtual instance with our presets and our other states that act similarly to presets in that they are a single source used multiple times. 

This is the thing that we are working on the questions we need answered and the systems we need stup in order to prototype it.  this information should be added to our uiONE element whiteboard doc to help us as we evaluate as well right?

**Purpose**: Entry point that loads theme and renders ONEconnect

## What App.tsx Does

1. **Loads UI Theme**
   - Uses themeProcessor to load 'ui' theme
   - Waits for theme before rendering
   - Shows loading state

2. **Provides Component Registry**
   - Empty `components` object (line 11)
   - Ready for ONE component registration

3. **Provides Store Registry**
   - Maps `oneStore` to useONEstore hook (line 18)
   - Passed to ONEconnect for data access

4. **Renders ONEconnect**
   - Wraps in `.ui` div for theme scoping (PENDING: might move to ONEconnect)
   - Passes theme, stores, and components

## Dependencies

- **ONEconnect**: See `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/01.04-ONEconnect.md`
- **useONEstore**: See `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/01.03-ONEstore.md`
- **themeProcessor**: See `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/01.05-THEMEprocessor.md`

## Current State

- ✅ Theme loading works
- ✅ Store connection ready
- ⏳ Component map empty (waiting for ONE component)

*App.tsx is complete and ready - just needs component registration*
