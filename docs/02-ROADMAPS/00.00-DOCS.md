# Documentation Philosophy

**Purpose**: How we write modular, single-source-of-truth documentation

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Modular Like Components**
Just like our UI components break down into reusable pieces:
- Button uses `:icon`, `:hover`, `:color-look`
- Card uses `:button`, `:hover`  
- Icon can exist alone or within button

Our docs work the same way:
- App.tsx references ONEconnect, not explains it
- ONEconnect has its own doc
- No duplication across files

### 2. **Single Source of Truth**
- **Line counts**: Only in 00-INDEX.md
- **System details**: Only in their own docs
- **No duplication**: Reference, don't repeat

### 3. **Focus on Direct Relationships**
Each doc contains ONLY what's directly related:
- App.tsx doc: What App.tsx does
- NOT: How theme processor works
- YES: "Uses theme processor (see 01.05)"

---

## What Goes in Each Doc

### ‚úÖ INCLUDE:
- Current line count (at top)
- Purpose (one line)
- What this specific file does
- Direct dependencies (as references)
- Current state/status

### ‚ùå EXCLUDE:
- Dependency explanations (link to their docs)
- Unrelated system information

---

## Document Types

### **00.xx - Control Documents**
- Indexes, guides, overall planning
- Not tracking specific code files
- Example: 00-INDEX.md, 00.01-ONE.md

### **01.xx - System Documents**
- Track actual implementation files
- Minimal, focused content
- Example: 01.01-APPtsx.md, 01.03-ONEstore.md

### **02.xx - Component Documents** (future)
- Individual component documentation
- Will follow same modular pattern

### **03.xx - Feature Documents** (future)
- Feature-specific guides
- Cross-references multiple components

## Example: Good vs Bad

### ‚ùå BAD (Old Style):
```markdown
# App.tsx Roadmap
## Implementation Status
### ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1)
- [x] Create minimal App.tsx (45 lines)
- [x] Connect to ONEstore 
### üîÑ Next Tasks (Phase 2: Theme)
- [ ] Add runtimeThemeProcessor
[20+ more lines of roadmap...]
```

### ‚úÖ GOOD (Modular Style):
```markdown
# App.tsx

**Current**: 48 lines  
**Purpose**: Entry point that loads theme and renders ONEconnect

## What App.tsx Does
1. Loads UI Theme
2. Provides Component Registry
3. Provides Store Registry  
4. Renders ONEconnect

## Dependencies
- **ONEconnect**: See `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/01.04-ONEconnect.md`
```

---

## Writing for Clarity

- **Write for beginners**: Explain what "lint" means
- **Be specific**: "48 lines" not "~50 lines"
- **Stay focused**: One topic per document
- **Reference freely**: Link to other docs
- **Keep it short**: If it fits on one screen, perfect

---

## System Priority Hierarchy

When implementing features, ask the questoin can this feature be immplimented with:
1. ONEconnect: Yes or NO? if NO then 
2. Store: Yes or NO? if NO then 
3. Utilities: Yes or NO? if NO then 
4. Theme Processor: Yes or NO? if NO then 
5. App.tsx: Last resort - or other like hooks etc.

*This approach keeps docs clean, prevents drift, and makes updates surgical rather than scattered*
