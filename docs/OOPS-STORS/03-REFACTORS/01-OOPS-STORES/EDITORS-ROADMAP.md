# Editors Component Evolution V2

## Overview
The Editors component has undergone a complete transformation from a 520-line monolith to a fully modular, composable system with independent sub-components that can be reused anywhere in the application.

## Architecture Evolution

### Before (V1):
```
Editors (monolithic)
  ├── EditorsHeader (tightly coupled)
  ├── EditorsSection (editors-specific)
  └── SimpleControl (with autocomplete)
```

### After (V2):
```
UISource (universal data provider)
  ├── SectionHeader (generic, configurable)
  ├── Accordion (generic, reusable anywhere)
  │   └── InputBar (generic, reusable anywhere)
  └── Accordion (multiple instances, data-driven)
```

---

## Size Evolution

- **Original:** 520 lines (monolithic)
- **V1 Refactor:** ~400 lines total
- **V2 Current:** ~296 lines total
  - EditorsWrapper: ~185 lines
  - EditorsHeader: 16 lines
  - Accordion: ~50 lines
  - InputBar: ~45 lines
- **Total Reduction:** 43% from original
- **Component Independence:** 100%

---

## Key Improvements V2

1. **Complete Component Independence**
   - Accordion can be used anywhere (not just editors)
   - InputBar is a generic form control
   - EditorsHeader is standalone
   - All components work via props, no dependencies

2. **Data-Driven Architecture**
   - EditorsWrapper loads theme variables
   - Dynamically creates accordion sections
   - Hydrates children with data
   - Clean separation of data and presentation

3. **Theme Integration**
   - Full preset support in all components
   - Nested preset targeting works perfectly
   - Components defined in ui-theme.json
   - Styled entirely through presets

4. **Simplified Approach**
   - Removed complex autocomplete system
   - Cleaner, more maintainable code
   - Focus on core editing functionality
   - Ready for future enhancements

## Component Capabilities

### EditorsWrapper
- Loads theme variables from "one" theme
- Categories variables automatically
- Provides data context to children
- Handles value changes and updates

### EditorsHeader
- Completely independent
- Accepts presetClassMap for styling
- Simple, focused component

### Accordion (Generic)
- Collapsible container component
- Icon support
- Toggle state management
- Full preset mapping support
- Can be used for any collapsible content

### InputBar (Generic)
- Label + input field combo
- Handles any type of input
- Change event handling
- Full preset mapping support
- Can be used in any form

## Breaking Changes from V1

1. **Component Renames:**
   - EditorsSection → Accordion
   - SimpleControl → InputBar

2. **Removed Features:**
   - Autocomplete functionality completely removed
   - Direct style injection removed

3. **New Requirements:**
   - Components must be registered in componentRegistry
   - Must handle presetClassMap prop
   - Defined in ui-theme.json structure

### ✅ Phase 7: ONE-CONNECT Integration
**Status:** COMPLETE (2025-09-13)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Updated component registration:**
   - InputBar now receives data through ONE-CONNECT data props
   - Accordion passes through sectionData and dataContext
   - GenericWrapper (editors-wrapper) ready for ONE-CONNECT
   - Removed event dispatching from InputBar

2. **Component updates:**
   - All components already pure (SectionHeader, Accordion, InputBar)
   - Accordion already handles ONE-CONNECT data hydration
   - No prop dependencies on App.tsx
   - All components work with stores through ONE-CONNECT

3. **Store integration:**
   - Components configured in ui-theme.json with data-actions
   - Uses oneStore.updateElementStyle for changes
   - Uses oneStore.getElementStyle for current values
   - Full store integration through ONE-CONNECT

- All extending InputBar patterns

### Phase 9: Advanced Visual Builder Features
**Status:** PLANNED (Enabled by Zustand)
- Transform handles with live sync
- Constraint system (aspect ratio, snapping)
- Multi-property updates
- CAD-style precision tools

## Integration with UIConnect

The Editors components now fully integrate with UIConnect's nested loading:

```json
"editors": {
  "data-component": "editors-wrapper",
  "children": ["header", "accordion"],
  "data-preset-targets": [":sidebar"]
}
```

This enables:
- Complete UI definition in theme
- Preset-based styling
- Component reusability
- Easy restructuring without code changes

---

## Achievements

- ✅ 43% code reduction from original
- ✅ 100% component independence
- ✅ Full TypeScript coverage
- ✅ Complete preset integration
- ✅ Recursive component support
- ✅ Clean, maintainable architecture
- ✅ ONE-CONNECT compatible
- ✅ Direct store integration (no events)
