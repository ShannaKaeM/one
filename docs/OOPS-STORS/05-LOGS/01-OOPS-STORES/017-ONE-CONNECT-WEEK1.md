   - Connected components for subscriptions
   - Auth mode support
   - Cloud sync preparation

### 3. TypeScript Status
- ✅ All ONE-CONNECT files compile without errors
- Ready for integration testing

## Architecture Overview

### Component Flow:
```
App.tsx
  ↓
OneConnect (orchestrator)
  ├── LayoutBuilder (grid/wrappers)
  ├── StoreConnector (Zustand subscriptions)
  ├── DataHydrator (data loading)
  └── ComponentLoader (recursive components)
```

### Theme Configuration Example:
```json
{
  "canvas": {
    "data-component": "direct-renderer",
    "data-source": "oneStore.elements",
    "data-subscriptions": ["oneStore.selectedElementId"],
    "data-actions": {
      "onSelect": "oneStore.setSelectedElement"
    },
    "data-auth": "optional",
    "data-cloud-sync": "auto"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session):
1. Test ONE-CONNECT with a simple component
2. Start DirectRenderer refactor planning

### Week 1 Goals:
- [ ] Complete ONE-CONNECT core
- [ ] Document patterns
- [ ] Begin DirectRenderer split

### Coordination Points:
- No conflicts with Supabase team (different files)
- Both teams can work at full speed
