## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Theme JSON Syntax Errors ✅
- Fixed incorrect quote characters in grid-template-areas
- Changed single quotes to escaped double quotes
- Resolved theme loading issues

### 2. Major Component Cleanup ✅
Deleted duplicate files in EDITORS:
- Removed: Accordion-OneConnect.tsx, Accordion-OneConnect-Fixed.tsx, Accordion.tsx
- Removed: InputBar-OneConnect.tsx, InputBar.tsx  
- Removed: EditorsWrapper-OneConnect.tsx, EditorsWrapper.tsx
- Kept only: Accordion.tsx, InputBar.tsx, SectionHeader.tsx

### 3. Switched from UIConnect to ONE-CONNECT ✅
- Updated App.tsx to use ONE-CONNECT instead of UIConnect
- Fixed import issues (useUiStore → useUIStore)
- Fixed layoutBuilder.ts JSX syntax error
- Added GenericWrapper for editors-wrapper component

### 4. Updated Theme Configuration ✅
- Changed editors preset target from "editors-container:sidebar" to ":sidebar"
- Added data-source and data-subscriptions to all main components:
  - layertree: oneStore.elements
  - canvas: oneStore.elements, selectedElementIds
  - library: libraryStore.items
  - canvas-controls: grid/snap subscriptions

### 5. Integrated PresetStore ✅
- Added presetStore to App.tsx imports
- Passed presetStore to ONE-CONNECT via stores object
- Initialized presetStore with theme presets on load
- Added layout change event handler

### 6. Fixed Styling Issues ✅
- Removed hardcoded inline styles from InputBar
- Changed flex display to grid in accordion-title
- Ensured all components use theme classes only

---

## Current Issues

### 1. Component Integration Errors
- LayerTree expecting old appState pattern (elements prop)
- Components not yet refactored for ONE-CONNECT data flow
- Need to complete refactor for full functionality

### 2. Layout System
- ONE-CONNECT successfully loading with dashboard layout
- Theme structure properly merged
- Layout switching connected but components need refactor

---

## File Changes

### Modified:
- `/src/App.tsx` - Switched to ONE-CONNECT, added presetStore
- `/src/components/one-connect/layoutBuilder.ts` - Fixed JSX syntax
- `/src/components/one-connect/OneConnect.tsx` - Fixed import case
- `/public/data/themes/ui-theme.json` - Fixed syntax, updated configs
- `/src/stores/uiStore.ts` - Already had toggleGrid/toggleSnap

### Created:
- `/src/components/one-connect/GenericWrapper.tsx` - Simple wrapper component
- `/src/components/EDITORS/InputBar.tsx` - Clean version without inline styles
- `/src/components/EDITORS/Accordion.tsx` - Clean grid-based version

### Deleted:
- 6 duplicate component files in EDITORS folder

---

## Next Steps for Next Agent

### Immediate Priority:
1. **Complete Theme Data Configuration**
   - Add missing data-actions to all components in ui-theme.json
   - Ensure all store methods referenced in theme actually exist
   - Add any missing store methods (like getElementStyle, updateElementStyle)
   - Test that all data subscriptions work properly

2. **Fix Component Data Flow**
   - Components expect props differently than ONE-CONNECT provides
   - Need to either:
     - Update components to accept data from ONE-CONNECT pattern
     - Or create adapter layer in component registry
   - Start with LayerTree as it's showing errors

3. **Continue DirectRenderer Refactor (Week 2)**
   - Split into modules as per FINAL-ONE-CONNECT-REFACTOR.md
   - Create proper ONE-CONNECT data mapping
   - Remove dependency on appState pattern

4. **Complete Store Integration**
   - All stores are connected but components need updates
   - PresetStore ready but not actively used yet
   - May need to add missing methods to stores

## Agent Handoff Notes

**Current State:**
- ONE-CONNECT is live and running
- Theme loads properly with all fixes
- Components render but with data flow errors
- Clean component structure (no duplicates)

**What Works:**
- Theme loading with proper grid layouts
- ONE-CONNECT wrapper creation with preset classes
- Store connections and subscriptions setup
- Layout switching infrastructure

**What Needs Work:**
- Components still expect old UIConnect/appState pattern
- DirectRenderer needs refactoring (1,241 lines → 400 lines target)
- Data flow between ONE-CONNECT and components needs adapter

**Recommendation:**
Continue with DirectRenderer refactor as it will establish the pattern for all other components. The errors will resolve as each component is refactored to work with ONE-CONNECT's data flow pattern.
