# 📝 Session Log: Toolbox Components

**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Session Focus:** Quick refactor of CanvasControls and LayoutSwitcher (minimal work needed)

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

Quick pass through two smaller utility components that were already well-structured. Mainly TypeScript improvements and icon extraction.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. **CanvasControls Component**

**Changes made:**
- Extracted GridIcon and SnapIcon to `icons.ts`
- Created TypeScript types in `controls.types.ts`
- Removed console.log
- Updated imports

**Minimal refactor because:**
- Already clean structure
- Clear purpose and scope
- Good inline styles approach

### 2. **LayoutSwitcher Component**

**Changes made:**
- Created TypeScript types in `controls.types.ts`
- Removed console.log
- Updated imports

**Uses emoji icons:** ▦, ▭, ▬, □, ◫, ⊞, ⬚

**Minimal refactor because:**
- Dynamic layout discovery
- Already well-organized
- Clean implementation

### 3. **Created controls.types.ts**

```typescript
- CanvasControlsProps interface
- LayoutSwitcherProps interface  
- LayoutInfo interface
```
