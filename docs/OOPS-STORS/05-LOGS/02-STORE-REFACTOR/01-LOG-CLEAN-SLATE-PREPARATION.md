# Log 01: Clean Slate Preparation

**Date**: 2025-09-15  
**Session Goal**: Remove all old stores and layout system to prepare for fresh 1store implementation

---

## What We Did

### Phase 0: Removed Old Stores
- Deleted 6 store files: appStore, elementStore, libraryStore, oneStore, projectStore, uiStore
- Kept presetStore temporarily (later deleted in Phase 0.5)
- Removed store imports from components

### Phase 0.5: Final Store Cleanup  
- Deleted presetStore.ts
- Removed all store code from components
- NOTE: Some store code was commented out instead of deleted - needs cleanup

### Phase 0.75: Layout System Removal
- Deleted `processThemeStructure.ts` - was handling layout children and grid area assignment
- Deleted `layoutBuilder.ts` - was creating wrappers and managing layout config
- Simplified `OneConnect.tsx` to minimal state
- Removed all component registrations from `registerComponents.ts`
- Cleared `dataComponentsMap` in App.tsx
- Removed all component imports from App.tsx

## Key Discoveries

1. **Layout Children Pattern**: System expected children array in layout presets, not in root
2. **editors-wrapper Mystery**: Found that GenericWrapper was mapped as 'editors-wrapper' causing confusion
3. **Auto Grid Assignment**: Old system auto-assigned grid areas (a,b,c...) to children

---

## Current State

- **App Status**: Blank screen with "OneConnect Ready - Layout system removed" message
- **Stores**: Complete clean slate - no stores connected
- **Components**: All deregistered but files preserved in their folders
- **Theme**: Structure simplified to just placeholder elements

---

## Next Steps

1. Check all components for commented store code and DELETE it
2. Begin Phase 1: Create new 1store.ts with 3 actors
3. Rebuild ONE-CONNECT rendering logic
4. Re-register components one by one with new store

## Agent Handoff

**For next agent:**

We've achieved a complete clean slate by removing all stores and the layout system. The app currently shows a blank screen which is expected. 

**Important notes:**
1. User prefers DELETION over commenting - if you find commented store code, delete it
2. New store should be named `1store` (not oneStore or ONEstore) 
3. User wants to rebuild systematically - ask before making changes
4. Check STORE-REFACTOR.md for the plan and rules

**Current working directory**: `/Users/shannamiddleton/Local Drive Mac/mi agency/miApps/studio1`

**Key files to know about:**
- `/docs/03-REFACTORS/STORE-REFACTOR.md` - The refactor plan
- `/src/components/one-connect/OneConnect.tsx` - Simplified and ready for rebuild
- `/src/App.tsx` - Clean with empty dataComponentsMap

Ready to start Phase 1: Create the new 1store!
