# Session 03 - Guardian Agent Architecture & Setup

**Date:** 2025-08-19
**Agent:** Opus
**Focus:** Designed Guardian Agent network and created implementation roadmap

## üéØ Session Accomplishments

### 1. Updated Atomic Documentation for Flat Component Pattern
- Created 2 new atoms (component-preset-distribution, react-integration-pattern)
- Updated 7 existing atoms and 2 L2 compositions
- Committed all changes to Git repository
- Deprecated css-prefix-separation.md based on Session 008 findings

### 2. Discovered Claude Agent Features
- Learned about `/agents` command for creating specialized agents
- Understood project vs global agents (keep project-based per Daniel)
- Realized we can create delegation system with separate memory/context

### 3. Designed Guardian Agent Architecture
- Every Guardian protects a **DOMAIN** (L1/L2/L3 hierarchy)
- Traffic light review system (üü¢ Green, üü° Yellow, üî¥ Red)
- Intelligent routing and escalation chains
- L2 Guardians act as coordinators, delegate to L1 specialists

### 4. Created Official Roadmap
- **Location:** `/01-GUARDIAN-DOCS/GUARDIAN-AGENT-ROADMAP.md`
- 16 Guardians with short, gender-balanced names
- 4-phase implementation plan
- Agent creation templates ready

## üöÄ Next Steps for Sonnet Agent

### Immediate Task: Create Sam (L3 System Guardian)

Use this command:
```
/agents create Sam "You are Sam, the L3 Guardian of the Complete System domain.

Your Domain:
- Primary: STUDIO1-COMPLETE-SYSTEM.md and overall platform coherence
- Connected: All L2 composition domains

Your Mission:
Protect the integrity of Studio1's complete system architecture by reviewing all changes for:
- Conflicts with ONE element philosophy
- Impact on the 4-pillar architecture
- System-wide coherence and integration

Review Protocol:
1. Analyze change against system architecture
2. Check impact on all subsystems
3. Determine traffic light status
4. Route to appropriate L2 Guardians or escalate to user

Response Format:
üü¢ 'Approved - maintains system coherence'
üü° 'Route to [Guardian] - affects [domain]'
üî¥ 'CONFLICT - breaks [principle] - escalate to user'"
```

### Test Sam's Review Capability
Test prompt:
```
"Sam, review this change: We're adding a new theme variable system that allows components to override any theme variable at runtime, bypassing the preset system entirely."
```

Expected response: Should flag this as potentially breaking the preset architecture and ONE element philosophy.

### Phase 1 Guardian Creation Order
1. **Sam** (L3 Complete System) - Create first
2. **Zoe** (L2 Theme Architecture)
3. **Ben** (L2 Transformer Architecture)
4. **Pat** (Main Doc Guardian - router)
5. **Ray** (L1 Preset Concept - CRITICAL)

## üìÅ Key File Locations

### Documentation
- Roadmap: `/01-GUARDIAN-DOCS/GUARDIAN-AGENT-ROADMAP.md`
- Atomic Docs: `/Users/shannamiddleton/Local Drive Mac/mi agency/miProjects/Studio1-Atomic-Docs/`
- This handoff: `/01-GUARDIAN-DOCS/GUARD-SESSION-LOGS/SESSION-03-GUARDIAN-AGENT-SETUP.md`

### Recent Updates
- New atoms in `/L1-ATOMS/ARCHITECTURE/` and `/L1-ATOMS/TRANSFORMER/`
- Updated compositions in `/L2-COMPOSITIONS/`
- Deprecated atom marked in `/L1-ATOMS/ARCHITECTURE/css-prefix-separation.md`

## üéØ Success Criteria for Phase 1

By end of Phase 1, you should have:
- [ ] Sam created and tested
- [ ] Basic routing working with Pat
- [ ] At least one Yellow/Red light scenario tested
- [ ] Zoe and Ben operational
- [ ] Successfully caught a real documentation conflict

## üí° Important Context

### Why Guardian Agents Matter
User gets overwhelmed with multiple docs and needs specialized agents to maintain documentation consistency. The Guardian network acts as an "immune system" protecting architectural integrity.

### Traffic Light Philosophy
- **Green**: No domain conflicts, proceed
- **Yellow**: Needs routing to specialist for review
- **Red**: Critical conflict, must escalate

### Key Insight from User
"Each L2 should delegate to their L1 children for domain-specific clearance since L2s are coordinators"
