# Session 15 - Project & Image Management System

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Overview
This session implemented a comprehensive local-first project management system with image upload capabilities, laying the foundation for a future Digital Asset Management (DAM) solution. The system allows users to save, load, export, and import projects while storing images as base64 data within the project structure.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Storage Manager Utility
Created `/src/utils/storageManager.ts` - A robust singleton class for handling all storage operations:

**Core Features:**
- Project CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Auto-save functionality with configurable intervals
- Export/Import JSON project files
- Image processing with base64 encoding (2MB limit)
- Storage usage tracking and quota management
- Project versioning and timestamps

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
// Project Management
createProject(name: string): Project
saveProject(project: Project): boolean
loadProject(projectId: string): Project | null
deleteProject(projectId: string): boolean
getAllProjects(): Project[]

// Import/Export
exportProject(project: Project): void
importProject(file: File): Promise<Project | null>

// Image Handling
processImage(file: File): Promise<string | null>  // Returns base64 data URL

// Auto-save
startAutoSave(project: Project, interval: number): void
stopAutoSave(): void
```

### 2. Project Manager UI Component
Created `/src/components/ProjectManager.tsx` - A floating UI bar for project management:

**Features:**
- Project dropdown selector showing all projects
- Save button (ðŸ’¾) with visual feedback
- Export button (ðŸ“¤) for downloading JSON
- Import button (ðŸ“¥) for uploading project files
- Auto-save indicator with "time ago" display
- Keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl/Cmd+S)
- New project creation dialog

**Visual Design:**
- Fixed position at top center of screen
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- Hover states on all interactive elements
- Active project highlighted in dropdown
- Real-time save status indicator

### 3. Image Upload Integration
Enhanced the existing layer system to support image uploads:

**Implementation:**
- When "Add Image" is clicked in element popup, file picker opens
- Images are converted to base64 using FileReader API
- Stored directly in element's layers array
- 2MB file size limit with user feedback
- Supports all common image formats (jpg, png, gif, webp, etc.)

**Code Location:** `/src/components/DirectRenderer.tsx` lines 93-148

### 4. React Hooks Fix
Resolved critical React hooks ordering issue in App.tsx:
- Moved all `useEffect` hooks before conditional returns
- Ensures consistent hook execution order on every render
- Prevents "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  name: string;            // User-defined project name
  version: string;         // Schema version for future migrations
  elements: any[];         // Canvas elements array
  theme: string;           // Active theme ('one' or 'ui')
  createdAt: number;       // Unix timestamp
  updatedAt: number;       // Unix timestamp
  thumbnail?: string;      // Future: Preview image
}

interface StorageData {
  version: string;
  projects: Project[];
  currentProjectId: string | null;
  settings: {
    autoSave: boolean;
    autoSaveInterval: number;
  };
}
```

### Local Storage Strategy
- Single key storage: `studio-one-data`
- JSON serialization for all project data
- Graceful handling of quota exceeded errors
- Estimated 5-10MB practical limit per domain

### Image Storage Approach
- Base64 encoding for images under 2MB
- Stored inline with element data
- No separate blob storage needed
- Trade-off: 33% size increase for portability

## Future DAM (Digital Asset Management) Vision

### Phase 1: Enhanced Local Media Library
- Create dedicated media library component
- Implement image deduplication (store once, reference many)
- Add image metadata (tags, dimensions, file size)
- Basic search and filter capabilities
- Thumbnail generation and caching

### Phase 2: Optimization & Organization
- Client-side image compression/resizing
- Smart cropping and focus point detection
- Folder/collection organization
- Batch operations (resize, convert, compress)
- Usage tracking (which elements use which images)

### Phase 3: Hybrid Storage
- IndexedDB for larger file storage
- WebWorker for background processing
- Progressive upload to cloud storage
- Local cache with cloud backup
- Offline-first with sync capabilities

### Phase 4: Full DAM Solution
- **Backend API** for centralized storage
- **CDN integration** for fast delivery
- **AI-powered features**:
  - Auto-tagging and categorization
  - Similar image search
  - Smart crop suggestions
  - Background removal
- **Collaboration features**:
  - Shared asset libraries
  - Version control for images
  - Comments and approvals
- **Advanced organization**:
  - Dynamic collections
  - Smart folders with rules
  - Asset relationships
- **Rights management**:
  - License tracking
  - Usage rights
  - Expiration dates

### Why Build Our Own DAM?
- **Cost**: Cloudinary and Adobe are expensive at scale
- **Control**: Full ownership of features and data
- **Integration**: Deep integration with ONE design system
- **Customization**: Tailored to specific workflow needs
- **Learning**: Great opportunity to understand DAM architecture

## Current Limitations & Known Issues

1. **Storage Limits**: Browser localStorage typically limited to 5-10MB
2. **Performance**: Large projects with many images may slow down
3. **No Compression**: Images stored at full size in base64
4. **No Sharing**: Projects are device-specific
5. **No Versioning**: Only latest version is saved
6. **No project deletion UI** (only in console)
7. **No project rename functionality**
8. **Missing confirmation dialogs**
9. **Storage quota not visible to user**
10. **No image optimization on upload**

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new project
- [ ] Save project (manual and auto-save)
- [ ] Load existing project
- [ ] Export project as JSON
- [ ] Import project from JSON file
- [ ] Add image to element (under 2MB)
- [ ] Try uploading image over 2MB (should show error)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+S
- [ ] Multiple projects in dropdown
- [ ] Delete project functionality

## Testing Guidance
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage has 'studio-one-data' key
3. Test with various image sizes (limit is 2MB)
4. Try export/import between browser sessions
5. Ensure auto-save indicator updates

## Useful Commands for Testing
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('studio-one-data') // View stored data
storageManager.getStorageInfo() // Check usage
storageManager.getAllProjects() // List projects
```

# Agent Handoff

## Current State
The project now has a fully functional local storage system with project management UI and image upload capabilities. All changes have been successfully implemented and the React hooks error has been resolved.

## Immediate Next Tasks

### 1. Testing Phase (User wants to test)
The user wants to test the new project management features before continuing with editor work. Ensure:
- Projects save and load correctly
- Images upload and display properly
- Export/import works as expected
- Auto-save functions reliably

### 2. Hook Up Spacing Controls
**Location**: `/src/components/EditorControls.tsx` (Spacing section around line 1425)
```typescript
// Current sliders need event handlers:
<PropertySlider label="Margin" value={16} unit="px" max={100} />
<PropertySlider label="Padding" value={24} unit="px" max={100} />
<PropertySlider label="Gap" value={12} unit="px" max={50} />
```
These need to use `PropertySliderWithInput` component and dispatch property changes.

### 3. Continue Color Editor Features
- Add preset color swatches (common colors)
- Copy/paste functionality for hex values
- Recent colors history
- Alpha channel in color picker

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Lazy load images in preview
- Implement virtual scrolling for large projects
- Debounce auto-save operations

## Important Notes
- The user prefers local-first approach
- Dislikes Cloudinary's complexity and Adobe's pricing
- Wants to build custom DAM integrated with ONE system
- Focus on simplicity and user control
- Keep everything modular for future expansion
- Remember: User wants to test thoroughly before continuing with editor editing features!

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented a complete local-first project management system with image support. The architecture is designed to scale from local storage to a full cloud-based DAM solution. Users can now persist their work across sessions, share projects via JSON export, and embed images directly in their designs. This forms a solid foundation for building a Cloudinary/Adobe alternative that's more affordable and tailored to the ONE design system needs.
