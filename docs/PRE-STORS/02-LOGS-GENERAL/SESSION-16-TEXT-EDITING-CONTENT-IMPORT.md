# Session 16 - Text Editing & Content Import System

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Overview
This session focused on implementing inline text editing capabilities and a comprehensive content import system. While the features are implemented, there are some issues that need to be resolved in the next session.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Typography Controls Connection
Successfully connected all typography controls in the Text tab to the ONE theme:

**Fixed Issues:**
- PropertySliderWithInput component wasn't receiving `onPropertyChange` callback
- Updated component to accept and use the callback prop
- Connected all typography sliders and controls

**Typography Properties Now Working:**
- Font Family (dropdown)
- Font Size (slider with input)
- Font Weight (dropdown)
- Font Style (Normal/Italic buttons)
- Text Transform (dropdown)
- Text Decoration (dropdown)
- Text Overflow (dropdown)
- White Space (dropdown)
- Word Break (dropdown)
- Text Align (grid buttons)
- Vertical Align (dropdown)
- Line Height (slider)
- Letter Spacing (slider)
- Word Spacing (slider)
- Text Shadow (X, Y, Blur, Color)

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Text Styles
**Problem:** Text layers had hardcoded styles (white color, 1.5rem size, 600 weight, text-shadow)
**Solution:** Modified DirectRenderer to inherit typography styles from parent element

```typescript
// Old hardcoded approach:
<span style="color: white; font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; text-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);">${textContent}</span>

// New approach - inherits from element styles:
const textStyles = {};
const textProperties = [
  'fontFamily', 'fontSize', 'fontWeight', 'fontStyle',
  'textTransform', 'textDecoration', 'textOverflow',
  'whiteSpace', 'wordBreak', 'textAlign', 'verticalAlign',
  'lineHeight', 'letterSpacing', 'wordSpacing', 'textShadow',
  'color'
];
textProperties.forEach(prop => {
  if (element.style && element.style[prop]) {
    textStyles[prop] = element.style[prop];
  }
});
```

### 3. Inline Text Editing Implementation
Created double-click text editing functionality:

**Features:**
- Double-click any text element to edit inline
- Blue outline appears when editing
- Text is automatically selected
- Press Enter or click outside to save
- Updates element's text layer value

**Code Location:** `/src/components/DirectRenderer.tsx` lines 920-995

### 4. Content Import System
Created comprehensive ContentImporter component:

**Features:**
- Modal interface with two import modes
- JSON Import: Accepts various formats
- Text Import: Each line becomes a text element
- Error handling with clear messages
- Sample JSON provided for reference

**Supported JSON Formats:**
```typescript
// Project export format
{ elements: [...] }

// Direct array
[{ id: "...", type: "one", ... }]

// Single element
{ id: "...", type: "one", ... }

// Content object
{ content: {...} }
```

**UI Integration:**
- Added import button (download icon) to CanvasControls
- Opens modal overlay
- Imported elements get unique IDs
- Positioned with offsets to avoid overlap

## Current Issues & Debugging

### 1. Text Editing Not Working
The double-click text editing is not functioning properly. Investigation revealed:

**Issue:** Move handle was blocking double-clicks
**Attempted Fix:** Moved handle from center to top (-20px)
**Status:** Still not working - needs further debugging

**Debug Console Logs Added:**
```javascript
console.log('üîç Double-click detected on:', e.target);
console.log('üîç Element ID:', elementId);
console.log('üîç Found element:', element);
console.log('üîç Text layer:', textLayer, 'Element type:', element.type);
console.log('üîç Text span:', textSpan);
```

### 2. Project Management Issues
User reports that project save and import aren't working correctly. Need to verify:
- StorageManager initialization
- Project save/load functionality
- Import/export features
- Auto-save mechanism

## Code References

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/components/EditorControls.tsx`
   - Updated PropertySliderWithInput to accept onPropertyChange
   - Connected all typography controls

2. `/src/components/DirectRenderer.tsx`
   - Removed hardcoded text styles (lines 1101-1122)
   - Added text editing listener (lines 920-995)
   - Added ContentImporter integration

3. `/src/components/ContentImporter.tsx` (NEW)
   - Complete import modal component
   - Handles JSON and text imports

4. `/src/components/CanvasControls.tsx`
   - Added import button
   - Connected to ContentImporter

5. `/src/components/SelectionHandles.tsx`
   - Moved move handle to top position

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented text editing and content import features, though both need debugging. Typography controls are fully connected and working. The foundation is solid but requires troubleshooting to get the interactive features functioning properly.

## Priority Tasks for Next Session

### 1. Fix Text Editing Double-Click
**Issue:** Double-click to edit text is not working
**Debugging Steps:**
- Check if double-click event is firing (console logs added)
- Verify span element selection
- Test without selection handles active
- Consider alternative approach (edit button in popup menu?)

### 2. Fix Project Management System
**Issues Reported:**
- Project save doesn't appear to be working
- Import functionality needs testing
- Auto-save indicator status unknown

**Check:**
- localStorage data structure
- StorageManager initialization
- Event listeners for save/load
- Console errors during operations

### 3. Review Overall Project Goals
As requested by the user, review the project's core objectives:
- Ensure implementations align with ONE system philosophy
- Verify features work cohesively
- Check that we're not over-engineering solutions

### 4. Complete Pending Features
- Hook up Spacing controls (margin, padding, gap)
- Test all typography controls thoroughly
- Ensure imported content respects current theme

## Important Context

**User's Immediate Needs:**
1. Get text editing working (double-click to edit)
2. Fix project save/load functionality
3. Ensure import/export works correctly
4. Review overall project architecture

**Known Working Features:**
- Typography controls in Text tab
- Content import modal UI
- Project Manager UI (visual only?)
- Text style inheritance from element

**Known Broken Features:**
- Double-click text editing
- Project save/load (reported by user)
- Possibly auto-save

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Double-click on TEXT - should make it editable
- [ ] Save project - verify in localStorage
- [ ] Load project - should restore elements
- [ ] Import JSON - should add elements
- [ ] Export project - should download JSON
- [ ] Typography changes - should apply to text

## Technical Notes

The text editing implementation uses contentEditable on the span element. The approach is sound but something is preventing the double-click from working. Possible issues:
1. Event propagation being stopped
2. Z-index issues with overlays
3. Pointer-events conflicts
4. React re-rendering interrupting the event

Consider adding a dedicated "Edit Text" button to the element popup menu as a fallback option.

Remember: The user wants to ensure we're building features that work together cohesively, not just adding isolated functionality.
