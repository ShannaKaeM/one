# Turning Everything Upside Down: AI-Era Design Revolution - FAQ

## What are we turning upside down?

The AI era has fundamentally changed what's possible. We're rethinking everything from first principles, discarding decades of both web development and graphic design limitations that no longer apply.

## What is it?
A **designer-driven, AI-assisted design system** that works for both web AND graphic design. Think Figma + Canva + Relume with AI superpowers and infinite export options.

## How is it different from existing tools?
❌ **NO** HTML/CSS during design  
❌ **NO** responsive breakpoints  
❌ **NO** switching between web and graphic design tools  
✅ **ONE** visual design experience  
✅ **AI assistance when you want it** (not required)  
✅ **Guardian system prevents AI drift**  

## What can I do with it?
🎨 **Design**: Drag-and-drop visual editing like Canva + Figma 
🤖 **AI Assist**: "Create Roy Lichtenstein preset library" → instant style system  
📚 **Build**: Create your own custom preset libraries  
📤 **Export**: SEO-HTML, React components, print, social media  

## Do I need to know code?
**Nope!** Design visually, system handles all the technical stuff automatically.

## What about SEO and web standards?
**Covered!** Upon export, the system hydrates your design into completely SEO-optimized, properly tagged HTML with perfect semantic structure.

## How does AI fit in?
AI is **your optional superpower tool**. Use it to generate entire preset libraries or complex effects instantly. Or create everything manually. Your choice.

## What makes it bulletproof?
**Guardian agents** with hard guardrails prevent AI drift. **Physical constraints** ensure nothing breaks. AI built the system, but can't break out of it.

## What about content creation?
**We've got you covered!** Add your own content manually OR have AI help generate it:
🖼️ **Images**: AI-generated graphics, complex visuals  
📝 **Text**: AI content generation like Relume  
📄 **Content**: Easy-to-use flat JSON content system  
🔄 **Portable**: JSON-powered for easy conversion to other systems  

## What about WordPress integration?
**Multiple WordPress options available!**
🔌 **Full WP Blocks**: Convert everything to complete WordPress blocks  
🧩 **Individual Editable Blocks**: Break down into individual block construction using libraries like Greenshift  
🛡️ **Shadow DOM**: Keeps your designs intact within WP  
🎛️ **Native WP Editability**: Full WordPress native editing when needed  
📋 **Custom Post Types**: Convert JSON to CPTs using hidden JSON concept  
🔒 **Best of Both**: JSON stays intact for your editing, clients get familiar CPT frontend editing  
🛒 **WooCommerce Ready**: Works with existing WooCommerce setups - design freedom without breaking your e-commerce workflow  
💰 **Investment Protection**: Keep your WooCommerce infrastructure while upgrading your design capabilities  
🔄 **Your Choice**: Seamless conversion OR full WordPress control OR traditional CPT system  

## Is everything portable?
**100% JSON-powered!** Your designs, content, and presets are all in portable JSON format - easily convertible to any other system or platform.

## What's the end result?
**Pure creative freedom** with **professional results**. One design becomes websites, print materials, React components, social media assets, WordPress blocks - whatever you need.
