# Session 05: Hotkey-Based Floating Panels Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-27

## Overview
This session focused on implementing a hotkey-driven floating panel system to replace the fixed editor sidebar. The goal was to create a clean workspace where controls only appear when needed via single-letter hotkeys.

## Starting Context
- Continued from previous session where selection UI was refined
- User wanted to remove the fixed editor sidebar completely
- Vision: Clean workspace with controls appearing only when needed
- Hotkey-activated floating panels that follow mouse and can be placed

## Major Accomplishments ✅

### 1. Removed Editor Sidebar
- Set `rightSidebarVisible: false` in App.tsx
- Updated dashboard layout to remove right column
- Gained significant canvas space for cleaner workspace

### 2. Created Modular Control Architecture
```
/components/editor/
  /controls/
    DimensionsControl.tsx     # First modular control
  FloatingPanel.tsx          # Initial attempt
  FloatingPanelV2.tsx       # Improved version
  FloatingPanelSimple.tsx   # Final working version
  EditorHotkeyManager.tsx   # Hotkey system
```

### 3. Implemented DimensionsControl
- Modular component following GeneralControls pattern
- Handles width, height, min/max dimensions
- Uses preset system for styling
- Fixed React hooks errors in implementation

### 4. Built Hotkey System
Single-letter hotkeys mapped in EditorHotkeyManager:
- **S** - Sizing/Dimensions (implemented)
- **T** - Typography (placeholder)
- **C** - Colors (placeholder)
- **B** - Borders (placeholder)
- **P** - Positioning
- **L** - Layout
- **G** - Grid
- **A** - Animations
- **E** - Effects
- **F** - Favorites
- **M** - Media

### 5. Added Theme Presets for Floating UI
Added new "floating" preset category to ui-theme.json:
```json
"floating": {
  "panel": { /* styles */ },
  "panel-placing": { /* styles */ },
  "panel-header": { /* styles */ },
  "panel-title": { /* styles */ },
  "panel-close": { /* styles */ },
  "panel-content": { /* styles */ },
  "placement-hint": { /* styles */ }
}
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Panel Not Detaching from Mouse
**Problem**: Panel wouldn't stop following mouse after clicking
**Root Cause**: Pressing hotkey again was toggling panel closed/open, resetting state
**Solution**: Changed hotkeys to only open (not toggle), require Escape to close

### 2. Panel Rendering Below Viewport
**Problem**: Panel appeared at bottom of page, not visible
**Solution**: Added `position: fixed` and high z-index inline styles

### 3. Click-to-Place Not Working
**Problem**: DirectRenderer intercepting mouse events
**Attempted Solutions**:
- Used mousedown with capture phase
- Added stopPropagation/preventDefault
- Increased z-index to 999999
**Final Solution**: Added Enter key as placement method (bypasses mouse conflicts)

### 4. Input Fields Not Accepting Multiple Characters
**Problem**: DirectRenderer intercepting keyboard events in inputs
**Partial Solution**: Added event.stopPropagation() to input handlers
**Status**: Still needs work - inputs only accepting single characters

## Current Implementation Status

### Working Features ✅
- Hotkey system (S, T, C, B, etc.)
- Panel follows mouse smoothly
- **Same hotkey (S) or Enter places panel**
- Escape closes panel
- Panel dragging after placement
- Theme integration for styling
- No viewport squeezing/narrowing
- **Fixed connection to DirectRenderer** (styles → style)

### Known Issues ⚠️
- Input fields only accepting single characters
- Click-to-place doesn't work (DirectRenderer conflict)
- Need to restart dev server for theme changes

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Portal Rendering
Using `createPortal(..., document.body)` to render outside React tree

### 2. Theme Integration
- Presets defined in ui-theme.json
- Runtime theme processor generates CSS classes
- Components use `ui` class prefix for scoping

### 3. Event Handling Strategy
- Hotkeys use simple letter keys (no modifiers)
- Enter for placement (avoids mouse conflicts)
- Escape for closing
- Event capture phase for priority handling

## Agent Handoff 🤝

### Current Status
The floating panel system is functional with Enter-key placement. The architecture is solid but input fields need fixing for full functionality.

### Immediate Priority - Fix Input Fields
The dimension inputs only accept one character. This is because DirectRenderer is intercepting keyboard events.

**Current attempted fix**:
```javascript
onKeyDown={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    e.currentTarget.blur();
  }
}}
```

**Suggested next steps**:
1. Check if DirectRenderer has a global keydown handler
2. Consider adding a "panel open" flag that DirectRenderer checks
3. May need to modify DirectRenderer to ignore events when `activePanel !== null`
4. Alternative: Create a keyboard event manager that routes events properly

### Next Features to Implement

#### 1. Complete Input Fix
- Ensure all keyboard input works in panel fields
- Test with different value types (px, %, rem, etc.)
- Add validation feedback

#### 2. Create More Control Modules
Following the DimensionsControl pattern:

**TypographyControl.tsx**:
- Font family dropdown
- Font size, weight, style
- Line height, letter spacing
- Text transform, decoration

**ColorControl.tsx**:
- Color picker integration
- Background, text, border colors
- Opacity controls
- Gradient builder

**BorderControl.tsx**:
- Border width, style, color
- Border radius (with individual corners)
- Box shadow builder

#### 3. Enhance Panel UX
- Save last position for each panel type
- Add visual indicators for available hotkeys
- Implement panel memory/favorites
- Add resize handles to panels

#### 4. Fix Click-to-Place
Once inputs work, investigate why DirectRenderer blocks placement clicks:
- May need a global "interaction mode" state
- Could use an invisible overlay for placement
- Consider pointer-events management

### Code Locations
- **Hotkey Manager**: `/src/components/editor/EditorHotkeyManager.tsx`
- **Working Panel**: `/src/components/editor/FloatingPanelSimple.tsx`
- **Dimensions Control**: `/src/components/editor/controls/DimensionsControl.tsx`
- **Theme Presets**: `/public/data/themes/ui-theme.json` (floating section)
- **App Integration**: `/src/App.tsx` (lines 472-497)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Select element → Press S → Panel appears
- [ ] Panel follows mouse without squeezing
- [ ] Press Enter → Panel places at mouse position
- [ ] Drag header → Panel moves
- [ ] Press Escape → Panel closes
- [ ] Type in inputs → All characters accepted
- [ ] Values update selected element
- [ ] Theme styles apply correctly

### Architecture Notes
- FloatingPanelSimple is the working version (not V2)
- Uses Enter key for placement due to mouse conflicts
- High z-index (999999) ensures visibility
- Portal rendering keeps it outside React tree
- Theme presets use CSS variables for consistency

Good luck with completing the input functionality! The foundation is solid - just needs the DirectRenderer conflict resolved. 🚀

## Late Session Updates (After Handoff)

### Fixed Issues
1. **Same Hotkey Placement**: Press 'S' again (or Enter) to place the panel at mouse position
2. **Property Connection**: Fixed mismatch between DimensionsControl expecting `selectedElement.styles` and DirectRenderer using `selectedElement.style` (no 's')
3. **Validation**: Removed restrictive regex validation - now allows free typing with DirectRenderer handling validation

These fixes should make the dimension inputs more functional, though keyboard event conflicts may still need resolution.
