# Session 05: Chakra UI Integration
## Date: 2025-08-31

### Starting Context
- Continued from Session 04 where we had:
  - Removed complex preset passing system
  - Fixed JSX parsing errors
  - Fixed element dragging (pointer-events issue)
  - Restored component styling with inline styles

### Objective
Integrate Chakra UI with the existing Studio One theme system on a new branch

### Work Completed

#### 1. Branch Setup
- Created new branch: `ONE-Chakra`
- Purpose: Test Chakra UI integration without affecting main development

#### 2. Chakra UI Installation
- Initially attempted Chakra v3 installation
- Encountered error: `The requested module does not provide an export named 'extendTheme'`
- Downgraded to Chakra UI v2.10.4 which has the required APIs
- Installed packages:
  ```bash
  npm install @chakra-ui/react@2.10.4 @emotion/react@11 @emotion/styled@11 framer-motion@11
  npm install @chakra-ui/icons@2
  ```

#### 3. Theme Bridge Creation
- Created `chakra-mi-theme.ts` to bridge CSS variables with Chakra theme
- Defined CSS variables:
  - `--mi-primary`: `hsl(342, 36%, 53%)` (Desaturated pink)
  - `--mi-secondary`: `hsl(32, 45%, 52%)` (Desaturated orange)
  - `--mi-neutral`: `hsl(0, 0%, 50%)` (Base neutral)
- Mapped to Chakra color system with full color scales

#### 4. GeneralControls Conversion
- Created `GeneralControls-chakra.tsx` using Chakra components:
  - Grid layout with 3 columns
  - IconButton components with tooltips
  - Custom SVG icons for all buttons
  - Hover states using secondary (orange) color
- Successfully integrated with UIGenerator
- All buttons now have consistent hover behavior

#### 5. LayerTree Conversion
- Created `LayerTree-chakra.tsx` with full functionality:
  - Dark theme preserved (black background, light text)
  - Drag-and-drop functionality maintained
  - Lock/visibility controls using Chakra IconButtons
  - Inline editing with Chakra Input component
  - Custom scrollbar styling
  - Hierarchical structure with expand/collapse
  - All original features working

#### 6. UIGenerator Integration
- Added ChakraProvider wrapping for Chakra components
- Modified component injection to support both regular and Chakra versions
- Created toggle system via `ui-config.ts`
- Components still respect grid areas from `ui-theme.json`

#### 7. Configuration System
- Created `ui-config.ts` with `useChakra` flag
- Allows switching between regular and Chakra components
- Updated App.tsx to conditionally use Chakra components

#### 8. Test Page Creation
- Created TestChakra component accessible at `?chakra`
- Demonstrates Chakra integration in isolation
- Shows hover states and theme color usage

#### 9. Code Cleanup (Current Session)
- Removed duplicate files:
  - Deleted `chakra-theme-new.ts`
  - Deleted `GeneralControls.new.tsx`
- Renamed Chakra components to be primary:
  - `GeneralControls-chakra.tsx` → `GeneralControls.tsx`
  - `LayerTree-chakra.tsx` → `LayerTree.tsx`
- Moved original components to `src/components/original-backups/`
- Simplified imports and removed toggle logic
- Fixed remaining import references in TestChakra

### Technical Achievements

#### Successful Integration Points
1. **Theme System Preserved**: UI theme JSON still controls layouts and component placement
2. **CSS Variable Bridge**: Chakra components use existing CSS variables for consistency
3. **Full Feature Parity**: All original functionality maintained in Chakra versions
4. **Dark Theme Support**: LayerTree maintains Studio One aesthetic
5. **Hover State Consistency**: All interactive elements use secondary color on hover

#### Architecture Benefits
- Components are now more accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Better performance with Chakra's optimizations
- Cleaner component code using Chakra's utilities
- Professional tooltips and interactions out of the box

### Issues Resolved
1. **Chakra v3 Compatibility**: Resolved by using v2.10.4
2. **Import Path Errors**: Fixed file naming mismatches
3. **404 Errors**: Updated all import references after file renames

### Current State
- GeneralControls: ✅ Fully converted to Chakra
- LayerTree: ✅ Fully converted to Chakra with dark theme
- EditorControls: ⏳ Pending conversion
- Library: ⏳ Pending conversion
- DirectRenderer: ⏳ May remain as-is (specialized component)

### Next Steps
1. Convert EditorControls to use Chakra form components
2. Convert Library to use Chakra cards/grid
3. Consider dynamic color scale generation from looks
4. Update documentation to reflect current implementation

## Additional Work Completed (Session Continuation)

### Code Cleanup Phase
- Removed duplicate theme files and components
- Renamed Chakra components to be primary versions
- Moved original components to backup folder
- Simplified configuration by removing toggle system
- Fixed all import references

### Library Component Conversion
- Full conversion of Library component to Chakra UI
- Implemented all modals using Chakra Modal components:
  - Upload modal with file selection
  - Library management modal
  - Collection management modal
  - Individual item edit modal
  - Bulk edit modal
- Converted filtering UI to use Chakra Tags
- Added Toast notifications for user feedback
- Maintained all functionality:
  - Drag and drop support

- Full theme system integration maintained
- All functionality preserved
- Minor performance issue: flickering during element movement

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix flickering issue** in SelectionHandles during drag operations
   - May need to optimize re-renders
   - Consider using React.memo or useMemo for performance
   
2. **Convert DirectRenderer modal** to Chakra Modal component
   - Currently using inline styles for library picker modal
   - Should match other modal implementations
   
3. **Convert SelectionActionButton** to Chakra
   - Small component but should be consistent
   
4. **Convert EditorControls** (most complex remaining)
   - Form inputs, selects, accordions
   - Color pickers and advanced controls
   - Will require careful planning
   
5. **Performance optimization**
   - Address any rendering performance issues
   - Ensure smooth interactions
   
6. **Update documentation**
   - Finalize CHAKRA-UI-GUIDE.md
   - Document component patterns
   - Create migration guide for future components

## Additional Work Completed (Session Continuation)

### Flickering Issue Resolution
- Fixed the flickering/loading message during drag/resize operations
- Separated theme loading logic from HTML generation in DirectRenderer
- Added `themeLoaded` state to cache theme loading status
- Theme now loads only once, preventing "Waiting for theme to load" message during interactions

### Component Conversions Completed

- Consistent use of CSS variables for theme colors
- Performance improvements through reduced re-renders
- All hover states use secondary color (orange) for consistency

## Atomic Editors System Implementation

### Vision and Concept
- Created atomic, composable editor system aligned with ONE element philosophy
- Each of 100+ CSS properties becomes individual editor component
- Editors can be composed, reorganized, and reused in different layouts
- Foundation for future drag-and-drop custom editor layouts with hotkeys

### New Editors Component
Created `src/components/Editors.tsx` to replace EditorControls with:
- Dynamic accordion sections generated from theme categories
- Atomic editor components for each property type
- Direct integration with ONE theme variables

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Dynamic Category Loading
- Reads categories directly from `one-theme.json`
- Automatically groups 114 properties into 12 categories:
  - animation, behavior, borders, colors, flex, grid
  - layout, positioning, sizing, spacing, typography, visual
- Categories update automatically when theme changes

#### 2. Atomic Editor Components Created
- **ColorEditor**: Color picker with text input
- **NumberEditor**: Slider with numeric input (for spacing, sizing)
- **SelectEditor**: Dropdown for predefined options
- **TextEditor**: Basic text input for string values

#### 3. Theme Integration Fix
- Initial load issue: theme wasn't loaded when component mounted
- Added async theme loading in useEffect
- Added manual refresh button as fallback
- Theme loads 114 properties across 12 categories

#### 4. Property Connection to Canvas
- Initial issue: Editors sent `style.backgroundColor` but DirectRenderer expected `backgroundColor`
- Fixed by removing `style.` prefix - DirectRenderer handles style object wrapping
- Property changes dispatch `element-property-changed` events
- DirectRenderer listens and updates element styles in real-time

#### 5. ONE Element Philosophy Integration
- Single element with infinite variations through properties
- All 100+ CSS variables pre-applied to each element
- Direct 1:1 relationship between element and variables
- Groups create wrapper elements that can also be styled

### Code Architecture

#### Editors.tsx Structure
```typescript
// Atomic editor components
const ColorEditor = ({ property, value, onChange, label })
const NumberEditor = ({ property, value, onChange, label, min, max, unit })
const SelectEditor = ({ property, value, onChange, label, options })
const TextEditor = ({ property, value, onChange, label })

// Main component
export function Editors({ selectedElement, onPropertyChange }) {
  // Dynamically load theme categories
  // Render accordion sections
  // Connect property changes to canvas
}
```

#### Integration Points
- App.tsx: Replaced EditorControls with Editors component
- UIGenerator.tsx: Wrapped with ChakraProvider
- DirectRenderer.tsx: Handles property changes via event system

### Issues Resolved
1. **Accordion visibility**: Fixed async theme loading
2. **Property sync**: Corrected event format for DirectRenderer
3. **Category organization**: Automated from theme structure

### Next Steps for Atomic Editors
1. Add specialized editors (visual border-radius, box-shadow builder)
2. Implement unit switching (px, %, vw, vh, rem)
3. Add visual feedback overlays on canvas
4. Create preset save/load functionality
5. Build drag-and-drop editor arrangement system
6. Add hotkey support for quick editor access
