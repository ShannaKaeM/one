# SESSION 06 HANDOFF DOCUMENT

## Current Branch: `uiJSON-REACT-INLINE`

## What We Accomplished
1. Implemented preset-driven architecture where UIGenerator creates components from JSON
2. Grid layout is working (red numbered areas visible in screenshot)
3. Components are being detected but not visually rendering
4. Cleaned up old code and reorganized project structure

## Immediate Issue to Fix
Components are rendering but not visible. From the console we can see:
- ✅ General component detected
- ✅ LayerTree component detected  
- ✅ Canvas component detected
- ✅ Library component detected
- ✅ EditorControls component detected
- ❌ But they're not visually apparent

## Most Likely Cause
The color presets aren't being applied properly. Components might be rendering with transparent or same-color-as-background styling.

## Quick Debug Steps
1. Inspect element on the top area where General controls should be
2. Look for element with classes: `ui wrapper general primary b`
3. Check computed styles - likely missing background-color or color

## Fix to Try First
```javascript
// In browser console, check if elements exist:
document.querySelector('.ui.wrapper.general')
document.querySelector('.ui.wrapper.primary')

// If they exist but aren't visible, it's a CSS issue
// Check if the CSS variables are applied:
getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('.ui.wrapper.general')).getPropertyValue('--background-color')
```

## Key Files to Check
1. `/src/components/General.tsx` - The component IS rendering (console shows it)
2. `/src/theme/runtimeThemeProcessor.ts` - How presets become CSS
3. Check browser DevTools > Elements > Styles to see what CSS is actually applied

## The Grid is Working!
The numbered red boxes (1, 2, 3, 4) show the grid areas are properly positioned. This means:
- dashboard-full layout is applied ✅
- Grid CSS is working ✅
- Just need to fix component visibility

## Next Session Plan
1. Debug why components aren't visible (CSS/color issue)
2. Fix the preset class application
3. Get layout switching working
4. Continue component conversion to preset-driven approach
