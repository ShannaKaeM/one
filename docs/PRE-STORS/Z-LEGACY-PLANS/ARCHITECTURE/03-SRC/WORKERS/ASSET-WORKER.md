## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Summary
> **Purpose**: Cloudflare Worker that manages all R2 storage operations and asset serving  
> **Type**: Edge API Worker

## ðŸ”„ Simple Explanation

Asset Worker is a **Cloudflare Worker** that runs on edge servers worldwide to handle all cloud storage operations:

1. **Uploads files** - Content-addressed with SHA-256 hashing
2. **Serves assets** - Fast CDN delivery with caching
3. **Manages library** - Save/load components and projects
4. **Processes images** - Automatic resizing and variants
5. **Handles CORS** - Cross-origin security

```
Upload file â†’ Asset Worker â†’ SHA-256 hash â†’ Store in R2 â†’ Return CDN URL
```

This is NOT a browser worker - it's a serverless API running on Cloudflare's network.

DELETE /library/{id}     - Delete item
GET    /asset/{hash}     - Serve asset
```

### Storage Buckets
- **ASSETS_BUCKET** - Raw files (images, etc.)
- **LIBRARY_BUCKET** - Component/project metadata
