# Content Upload & Management Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status (Jan 8, 2025)

### What's Working ✅
- Component Registry System - DONE
- Layout Switcher - DONE  
- CSS Grid Layout - DONE
- Canvas Rendering - DONE
- Editors Panel - DONE
- Phase 1: Text Upload to Library - COMPLETE
- LayerTree Styling - DONE
- Content Persistence (main elements) - DONE
- Layout Switching - DONE
- Grid Area Assignment - DONE

### What Needs Work ❌
- Text/Media elements not persisting across layouts
- Text/Media elements cannot be moved/resized properly
- Save to Library functionality incomplete
- Phase 2: Text Editing - Implemented but broken

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Fix Text/Media Element Issues
**Critical: Text and media presets are not working correctly**

Issues to fix:
- Elements with text/media presets don't persist across layouts
- Cannot move or resize text/media elements
- Upload functionality partially broken
- Elements disappear or behave unexpectedly

Root cause likely:
- Preset application interfering with element state
- Special handling for text/media not compatible with lifted state
- Event handlers may be disconnected

### 2. Complete Save to Library Modal
- Add UI for selecting library/collection
- Let users name their saved element
- Handle both text and media saves
- Show success/error feedback

### 3. Fix Text Editing (Phase 2)
- Double-click to edit not working
- Markdown rendering issues
- Content not updating properly
- Edit overlay positioning

### 4. Test Complete Upload/Edit/Save Flow
End-to-end testing:
1. Upload text from desktop
2. Edit text content
3. Save back to library
4. Use from library again

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Element Type System
Currently mixing concepts:
- Element type (one/ui)
- Preset type (wrapper/text/media)
- Applied presets array
- Content type detection

Need unified approach for element types.

### Event System
Too many similar events:
- element-property-changed
- canvas-elements-updated
- element-selected
- content-updated

Consider consolidating events.

## 🚨 PRIORITY ORDER FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **Debug Text/Media Elements**
   - Why don't they persist like wrapper elements?
   - Fix movement/resize issues
   - Ensure presets work with lifted state

2. **Complete Save to Library**
   - Modal UI implementation
   - Library/collection selection
   - Success/error handling

3. **Fix Phase 2 Text Editing**
   - Restore double-click functionality
   - Fix edit overlay
   - Ensure content updates properly

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Full upload → edit → save → reuse flow
   - Test all element types
   - Verify persistence across all operations

## 💡 Key Insights from This Session

1. **JTR Wrapper System**: Using `[":"]` for clean wrappers was critical
2. **Layout Children Filtering**: Only render components in active layout
3. **State Lifting**: Elements must be at App level for persistence
4. **ID Generation**: Centralized system prevents conflicts
5. **Grid Areas**: Applied to wrappers, not components

These discoveries enable the foundation for completing the content system!
