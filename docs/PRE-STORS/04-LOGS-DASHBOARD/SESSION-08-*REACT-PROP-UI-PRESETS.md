git commit -m "feat: Component-Level Preset System - Major Architecture Breakthrough ðŸš€

MILESTONE: Solved the preset targeting architecture issue!

## What Changed:
- Created new GeneralControls component with clean preset system
- Implemented component-level presets passed as props
- Components now handle their own styling at render time
- No more post-render DOM manipulation

## Architecture Pattern:
ui-theme.json â†’ UIGenerator â†’ Component Props â†’ Render-time styling

## Key Features:
- Grid and snap toggle functionality restored
- CSS-only hover effects working
- Active state presets applying correctly  
- 3-column layout with proper grid areas (a, b, c)
- Buttons displaying in horizontal rows via repeator preset

## Components Updated:
- GeneralControls: New clean component with preset props
- UIGenerator: Now passes presets as props instead of DOM manipulation
- ui-theme.json: Updated with GeneralControls config and hover states

This establishes the pattern for all future component styling!"
