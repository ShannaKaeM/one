# Session Log: 2025-09-03 - HYDRATION

## Session Summary
Implemented CSS-based child hydration system using custom properties and nth-child selectors, enabling parent containers to automatically style their children based on position.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Child Alignment Hydration System ✅
Created a powerful hydration pattern where parent grids can define how their children align:
- Implemented `_child-alignment` special property in theme presets
- Theme processor generates `:nth-child()` CSS rules automatically
- Children receive alignment based on their position in parent

### 2. Smart Box Container ✅
Made the core `box` preset "hydration-aware":
```json
"box": {
  "--justify-items": "var(--parent-justify-items, stretch)",
  "--align-items": "var(--parent-align-items, stretch)"
}
```
- Box listens for parent-provided CSS custom properties
- Falls back to default values when no hydration present
- Enables cascade-based inheritance

### 3. Grid Presets Enhanced ✅
- Created `grid-cols-aligned` with built-in child alignment
- Fixed grid area auto-assignment to work for all elements (not just leaves)
- Added multiple grid layout presets for common patterns

### 4. Override Capability ✅
Children can override parent hydration by applying their own presets:
- Direct CSS values take precedence over inherited values
- Maintains flexibility for manual control
- Perfect for visual builder needs

## Technical Implementation

### Theme Processor Enhancement
```javascript
// Handle special child alignment rules
if (value['_child-alignment'] && typeof value['_child-alignment'] === 'object') {
  Object.entries(value['_child-alignment']).forEach(([childIndex, alignment]) => {
    css.push(`.${key} > :nth-child(${childIndex}) {`);
    css.push(`  justify-self: ${alignment};`);
    css.push(`  align-self: center;`);
    css.push(`  --parent-justify-items: ${alignment};`);
    css.push(`  --parent-align-items: center;`);
    css.push('}');
  });
}
```

### Example Grid Preset
```json
"grid-cols-aligned": {
  "--display": "grid",
  "--grid-template-columns": "250px 1fr 250px",
  "--grid-template-rows": "1fr",
  "--grid-template-areas": "'a b c'",
  "_child-alignment": {
    "1": "start",
    "2": "center",
    "3": "end"
  }
}
```

### How It Works
1. Parent container has `_child-alignment` configuration
2. Theme processor generates CSS targeting `:nth-child(n)`
3. Sets both positioning (`justify-self`) and content alignment (`--parent-justify-items`)
4. Box preset reads parent properties via CSS custom properties
5. Children automatically align based on position
6. Can be overridden with direct presets

## Visual Builder Benefits
- **Context-Aware**: Elements adapt to their container automatically
- **Position-Based**: Moving elements changes their styling
- **Override-Friendly**: Manual control when needed
- **No JS Required**: Pure CSS solution
- **Infinitely Nestable**: Works at any depth

## Grid Updates
- Fixed `grid-bento-5` template areas spacing
- Added `grid-rows` and `grid-cols-aligned` presets
- Removed redundant flex-based containers (staying grid-only)
- Enhanced auto-grid assignment to include all elements

## Agent Handoff

### Current State
- Hydration system fully operational
- Box preset is hydration-aware
- Theme processor supports `_child-alignment` patterns
- Grid layouts working with proper child alignment
- Override system tested and functional

### Next Steps
1. Explore named-based hydration (`scope: "start"`)
2. Add grid-area-based hydration
3. Create more hydration patterns:
   - `_hydrate-children` for property injection
   - `_area-styles` for grid-area-based styles
4. Build preset inheritance system
5. Document hydration patterns for users

### Critical Innovation
This hydration system enables visual builders where content automatically adapts to containers. When users drag elements between different containers, the elements automatically adopt appropriate styling without manual intervention, while still allowing explicit overrides when needed.
