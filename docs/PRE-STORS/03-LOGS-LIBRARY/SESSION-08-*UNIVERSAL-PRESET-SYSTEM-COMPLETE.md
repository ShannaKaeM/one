# SESSION 08: Universal Preset System Complete

## Session Overview
Implemented the ONE element architecture with universal preset system. Changed from separate element types (wrapper/text/image) to a single 'one' element type with toggleable presets (wrapper/text/media). This creates a flexible system where any element can be transformed through preset application.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ONE Element Architecture
- Changed all elements to use type: 'one' 
- Removed legacy 'wrapper' type references
- Created minimal base element (position: relative, display: block)
- Elements start invisible until presets are applied

### 2. Three Base Presets
- **Wrapper**: Container styling (200x200px, gray background, grid centered)
- **Text**: Typography and text-specific styling
- **Media**: Container with image background capabilities

### 3. Preset Behavior Rules
- Wrapper and Media are mutually exclusive (both containers)
- Text can layer on either Wrapper or Media
- All presets are toggleable with visual feedback (âœ“)
- Presets properly layer instead of override

### 4. Fixed Issues
- Removed inline styles and hardcoded values
- Fixed preset variable application
- Added placeholder pattern for media preset
- Ensured text persists when switching between wrapper/media

## Technical Implementation

### Element Creation
```javascript
// All elements now created as type: 'one'
const newElement = {
  id: `element-${Date.now()}`,
  type: 'one',
  name: `ONE ${elementCount}`,
  content: {
    text: '',  // Direct text content
    src: ''    // Direct image source
  },
  style: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: '50px',
    left: '50px'
  }
};
```

### Preset Application
- CSS variables defined in presets
- Variables converted to actual styles during render
- Multiple presets merge their variables
- User styles override preset styles

## Agent Handoff / Next Steps

### Library System Completion (High Priority)
1. **Complete Library-Canvas Connection**
   - Fix library image selection to properly add to canvas
   - Ensure presets are applied based on content type
   - Test with various media formats

2. **Library Import Intelligence**
   - Apply appropriate presets on import (text preset for text content, media preset for images)
   - Handle mixed content gracefully
   - Preserve existing presets when updating content

3. **Library UI Polish**
   - Ensure library picker works with new preset system
   - Add visual indicators for content types
   - Improve selection feedback

### Future Phases

**Next Phase - Preset Expansion**
- Additional presets (typography variants, buttons, cards, layouts)
- Preset management UI in sidebar

**Other Future Phases - Export**
- Flatten system for complex preset combinations
- Export ONE elements as semantic HTML

## Session Summary
Successfully implemented the revolutionary ONE element system with toggleable presets. This creates unprecedented flexibility where any element can transform between container, text, or media through preset application. The architecture is clean, extensible, and ready for library integration completion.
