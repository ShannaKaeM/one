# Session 12: Library Fixes and Full Audit

## Date: 2024-01-24

## Overview
This session focused on fixing library image display issues, removing unused components (SimpleLibraryPicker, ImageSourceSelector), and conducting a full audit of the codebase. We successfully got images working on the canvas and deployed the Cloudflare Worker.

## Initial Issues
1. Images showing in LayerTree but not visually on canvas (only blue selection handles)
2. Library not persisting after refresh
3. Images using non-existent `library-media` preset
4. Library thumbnails not displaying

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Components
- **Deleted Files:**
  - `src/components/SimpleLibraryPicker.tsx`
  - `src/components/ImageSourceSelector.tsx`
  
- **Updated DirectRenderer.tsx:**
  - Removed imports for both components
  - Removed state variables: `showImageSource`, `imageSourceTarget`, `pendingImageElementId`, `showLibraryPicker`
  - Removed handlers: `handleDesktopImageUpload`, `handleLibraryImageSelect`
  - Updated `handleAddLayer` to only handle text layers
  - Removed duplicate event listeners
  - Removed component renders from JSX

- **Updated SelectionActionButton.tsx:**
  - Removed `add-image-layer` case
  - Removed `select-image` case

- **Updated ElementPopup.tsx:**
  - Removed automatic image selection trigger when applying media preset
  - Added comment: "User should drag image from library after applying media preset"

### 2. Fixed Preset Usage
Changed from non-existent `library-media` to standard `media` preset:
- **UIGenerator.tsx:** Lines 456-457
- **DirectRenderer.tsx:** Lines 1136-1137 and 1141-1142

### 3. Fixed Image Rendering
The key fix was changing how images are rendered in DirectRenderer:

**Old approach (not working):**
```javascript
// CSS background-image
elementStyle.backgroundImage = `url("${imageSrc}")`;
```

**New approach (working):**
```javascript
// Actual <img> tag inside the div
if (appliedPresets.includes('media') && imageSrc) {
  innerContent = `<img src="${imageSrc}" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;" alt="${element.name || 'Media'}" />`;
}
```

### 4. Fixed URL Handling
- Added URL conversion from relative to absolute in multiple places
- Library.tsx: Lines 222-224 convert `/asset/...` to full URLs when loading
- DirectRenderer.tsx: Lines 1366-1370 convert URLs when rendering

### 5. Library Persistence
- Confirmed R2 is working and storing images
- Library items are persisted and reload on refresh
- Issue was with URL format and CORS

### 6. Deployed Cloudflare Worker
- Worker already had CORS headers configured
- Successfully deployed using `npx wrangler deploy`
- Worker URL: https://studio-one-assets.studio-one.workers.dev

## Current Status

### Working ✅
1. **Upload images to library** - Files upload successfully to R2
2. **Images persist** - Library items remain after refresh
3. **Drag & drop to canvas** - Library items can be dragged onto canvas
4. **Canvas image display** - Images show correctly using `<img>` tags inside ONE elements
5. **Media preset application** - ONE elements properly use media preset
6. **URL conversion** - Relative URLs converted to absolute

### Not Working ❌
1. **Library thumbnails** - Still showing placeholder icons instead of image previews
   - Likely CORS issue despite worker having headers
   - May need additional configuration or cache clearing

## Technical Details

### ONE Element Structure with Images
```html
<div class="one media" style="position: absolute; ...">
  <img src="https://studio-one-assets.studio-one.workers.dev/asset/[hash]" 
       style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;" />
</div>
```

### Library Item Structure
```typescript
interface LibraryItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  url: string;  // Full URL to asset
  categories: string[];
  createdAt: number;
}
```

### Worker Configuration (wrangler.toml)
```toml
name = "studio-one-assets"
main = "src/workers/asset-worker.js"
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "ASSETS_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "studio-one-assets"
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "LIBRARY_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "studio-one-library"
```

## Agent Handoff - Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Library Thumbnails
The library thumbnails are not displaying despite the worker having CORS headers. Investigation needed:

1. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
   - Refresh the page
   - Look for image requests to `studio-one-assets.studio-one.workers.dev`
   - Verify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is in response headers

2. **Possible Solutions:**
   - Clear Cloudflare cache: `npx wrangler r2 object delete studio-one-assets [key] --cache-control max-age=0`
   - Check if different headers needed for `<img>` in React vs canvas
   - Try adding `crossorigin="use-credentials"` instead of removing it
   - Check browser console for specific CORS error messages

3. **Alternative Approach:**
   If CORS continues to be an issue:
   - Generate base64 thumbnails during upload
   - Store thumbnails separately in library metadata
   - Use a proxy endpoint in the worker for thumbnails

### Priority 2: Complete Codebase Audit
The user requested a full audit for leftover functions. Areas to check:

1. **Theme Processor** (`src/theme/runtimeThemeProcessor.ts`)
   - Look for unused theme loading functions
   - Check for library-specific theme handling
   - Remove any references to deleted components

2. **App.tsx**
   - Check for unused library-related state
   - Remove any imports for deleted components
   - Clean up event listeners for removed features

3. **DirectRenderer.tsx**
   - Look for unused helper functions
   - Check for dead code from old image handling
   - Verify all event listeners are necessary

4. **UIGenerator.tsx**
   - Check for unused component mappings
   - Verify all data-component handlers are valid

### Priority 3: Library Features Enhancement
Once thumbnails are working:

1. **Multi-library Support** (user's goal)
   - Allow saving to different named libraries
   - Single source (R2) with multiple views
   - Library switching UI

2. **Better Error Handling**
   - Show upload progress
   - Handle failed uploads gracefully
   - Retry mechanism for failed thumbnails

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy load library items
   - Virtual scrolling for large libraries
   - Thumbnail caching strategy

### Priority 4: Documentation
Create user documentation for:
- How to upload images
- How to organize with categories
- How to use media preset
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+L for library)

### Important Notes
- The system is functional - only thumbnail preview is broken
- Don't change the image rendering approach (img tags work)
- Keep using standard `media` preset, not custom presets
- R2 worker is deployed and functional

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Library thumbnails display after CORS fix
- [ ] Images persist after page refresh
- [ ] Drag & drop works smoothly
- [ ] Multi-select and delete works
- [ ] Categories filter properly
- [ ] Canvas images render at correct size

Good luck with the next session!
