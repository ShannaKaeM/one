# üìù Session Log 005: Preset System Implementation & Store Reorganization

**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Session Focus**: Implemented full 4-component preset system and reorganized store to flat structure  
**Key Achievement**: Virtual components can now be styled with live CSS updates!

---

## üéØ Session Overview

Started by reviewing documentation and auditing systems. Major reorganization of ONEstore to flat structure with everything as assets. Implemented complete preset system for virtual component styling.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated uiONE whiteboard with 3 component registration options
- Cleaned up App.tsx doc (removed notes)
- Added system priority hierarchy to DOCS
- Created comprehensive preset system roadmap

### 2. **Store Reorganization - FLAT Structure**
- Removed ALL hardcoded values (layouts, tools, panels)
- Everything is now theme-driven
- Eliminated nested actors - direct access to all state
- Everything is an asset (elements, images, presets, styles)
- Complete rewrite of ONEstore.ts (388 lines)

### 3. **Preset System Implementation (4 Components)**

#### Theme Processor Enhanced:
- Added processPresets() method
- Generates CSS classes from theme presets
- Supports compound (.ui.primary) and descendant (.ui .sidebar) selectors
- Handles state variations (_hover, _active)

#### ONEstore Updated:
- Added preset system state:
  - activePresets: { [assetId]: string[] }
  - globalPresets: { [assetType]: string[] }
  - availablePresets: string[]
  - presetInheritance: { [assetId]: string[] }
- All preset actions implemented

#### PresetManager Created (New):
- Runtime CSS variable updates
- Subscribes to store changes
- Injects dynamic styles per asset
- Live updates without reload
- Conflict resolution

#### ONEconnect Enhanced:
- Reads currentView from store (not hardcoded)
- Applies active presets as classes
- Deep path support in StoreConnector
- Ready for preset targeting

### 4. **Key Discoveries**
- Hardcoded values were causing Loop/LayoutSwitcher issues
- Flat store structure is much cleaner
- PresetManager is CRITICAL for flexibility
- Everything as assets simplifies mental model

## üìã Current State

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Theme processor generates preset CSS
- ‚úÖ Store tracks all preset state
- ‚úÖ PresetManager provides live updates
- ‚úÖ ONEconnect reads from store dynamically
- ‚úÖ Virtual components can be styled!

### What's NOT Connected Yet:
- Theme JSON files need preset definitions
- No actual components using the system yet
- Need to test virtual component creation

---

## üö® Handoff to Next Agent

### Critical Context:
1. **Flat Store Structure** - No more nested actors!
2. **No Hardcoded Values** - Everything from theme
3. **4-Component Preset System** - All implemented
4. **Everything is an Asset** - Unified approach

### Next Priority: Test Virtual Components

Create a test theme with:
```json
{
  "presets": {
    "looks": {
      "primary": {
        "backgroundColor": "blue",
        "color": "white"
      }
    },
    "components": {
      "sidebar-wrapper": {
        "width": "250px",
        "height": "100%"
      }
    }
  },
  "structure": {
    "sidebar": {
      "data-component": "uiONE",
      "presets": ["primary", "sidebar-wrapper"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Steps:
1. ONEconnect should create a div (no React component)
2. Store should track active presets
3. PresetManager should inject CSS variables
4. Visual styling should appear

### Important Files Changed:
- `/src/stores/ONEstore.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `/src/SYSTEMS/theme-processor/ThemeProcessor.ts` - Added presets
- `/src/SYSTEMS/preset-manager/` - New component
- `/src/SYSTEMS/one-connect/ONEconnect.tsx` - Enhanced
- `/src/App.tsx` - Initializes PresetManager

### Warnings:
- Store structure completely changed - update any components using old structure
- All values must come from theme now
- Test thoroughly before building on top

---

## üéÆ Ready for Virtual Components!

The foundation is complete. Virtual components can now be:
1. Created as auto-generated divs
2. Styled via presets from theme
3. Updated live without reload
4. Fully theme-driven
