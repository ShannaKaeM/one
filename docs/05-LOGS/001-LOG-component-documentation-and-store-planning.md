# üìù Session Log: Component Documentation & Store Planning

**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Session Focus:** Documenting all major components from OOPS-STORS to plan ONEstore structure

---

## üéØ Session Overview

Created comprehensive documentation for all major components to understand state requirements before implementing ONEstore. This is Phase 1 of the ONE project - understanding what we're building based on the refined OOPS-STORS implementation.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. **Created Component Documentation Template**
- Refined template based on user feedback
- Focus on single source of truth (no repetition)
- Organized by domains: State, ONEconnect, Theme, Presets, Icons, etc.
- Location: `/docs/03-COMPONENTS/COMPONENT-TEMPLATE-V2.md`

### 2. **Documented All Major Components**

#### Organisms (Complex Components)
1. **Editors** (~296 lines)
   - Modular: Header, Accordion, InputBar atoms
   - ONE theme integration (100+ CSS variables)
   - Direct store communication
   - Issue: Wrapper generation needs fixing

2. **LayerTree** (660 lines)
   - Hierarchical element display
   - Drag & drop reordering
   - Direct store integration complete
   - Fully TypeScript, zero events

3. **Library** (~1,500 lines across 7 files)
   - Has its own libraryStore
   - R2 storage integration
   - Complex filtering and bulk operations
   - Largest component system

4. **DirectRenderer** (3,203 lines!)
   - MASSIVE - needs splitting
   - Core canvas functionality
   - useElementHandlers hook is 859 lines alone
   - Fully migrated to Zustand

5. **Loop** (Future: CanvasControls + LayoutSwitcher)
   - Groundbreaking innovation coming
   - Universal control pattern
   - Dynamic discovery from theme

#### System Components
1. **ONEconnect** (~600 lines)
   - Component orchestration system
   - Generic wrapper magic
   - Store ‚Üí Component data flow
   - Zero events

2. **App.tsx** (105 lines, down from 548!)
   - 81% code reduction
   - Zero state, zero events
   - Clean initialization only

3. **runtimeThemeProcessor** (566 lines)
   - JSON ‚Üí CSS converter
   - Import system for modular themes
   - Smart scoping (`.ui`, `.one`)

### 3. **Key Insights Discovered**

#### State Patterns
- **Local State**: Only for temp UI (modals, drag states, form inputs)
- **Store State**: All shared data
- **selectedElement** not selectedElements (only one at a time)

#### Naming Conventions
- ONEstore not oneStore
- ONEconnect not ONE-CONNECT
- Capitals first, lowercase second for two words

#### Wrapper Issues
- ONE-CONNECT generates extra divs
- "editors-wrapper" is generic, not a real component
- Need to merge wrapper logic or make dynamic

#### Store Architecture Emerging
```
ONEstore:
  Designer Actor: User actions (selection, tools)
  Workspace Actor: UI state (layout, panels)
  Projects Actor: Data (elements, metadata)

libraryStore: Separate for library complexity
```

## üìã Next Steps for Agent

### Immediate TODOs
1. **Document Remaining Systems**:
   - Grid Areas system
   - Loop Items pattern
   - Stores (all of them)
   - Systems folder
   - Utils folder

2. **Document Core Concepts**:
   - Themes (UI vs ONE)
   - Core Variables (100+)
   - Atomic Design Principles
   - Project Rules

3. **Create Minimal ONEstore**:
   - Start with essential states from component analysis
   - Designer: selectedElement, currentTool
   - Workspace: activeLayout, panelStates
   - Projects: canvasElements

4. **Cross-Reference Documentation**:
   - Check for duplicate state definitions
   - Ensure consistent naming
   - Identify shared utilities

### Important Context
- We're building ONE based on refined OOPS-STORS
- OOPS has legacy issues but is most evolved
- Question everything, don't blindly copy
- Focus on facts, not comparisons

### Key Decisions Made
- Base everything on OOPS-STORS state
- Look to pre-Zustand (studio1) only for hints
- No semantic naming - generic and reusable
- Single source of truth for all info

## üöÄ Technical Summary

### Components Documented
| Component | Type | Size | Key Feature |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| Editors | Organism | 296 lines | Theme variables UI |
| LayerTree | Organism | 660 lines | Hierarchy + drag |
| Library | Organism | 1,500 lines | Own store + R2 |
| DirectRenderer | Organism | 3,203 lines | Needs splitting! |
| ONEconnect | System | 600 lines | Orchestration |
| App.tsx | Root | 105 lines | 81% reduced |
| runtimeThemeProcessor | System | 566 lines | JSON ‚Üí CSS |
| Loop | Future | 350 lines | Unified controls |

### Store Requirements Found
- Multiple selected elements? No, just one
- Lots of temp UI state stays local
- Library complex enough for own store
- Direct store calls, no events

## üéâ Session Achievements

1. Created refined component documentation template
2. Documented 8 major components/systems
3. Identified store architecture patterns
4. Found key issues to address (wrappers, naming)
5. Set foundation for ONEstore implementation

## üìù Agent Handoff Notes

The user is building a fresh start (ONE) based on lessons learned from OOPS-STORS. We're in the documentation phase to understand all components before implementing stores. The user is very particular about:

1. **Naming**: ONEstore, ONEconnect (capitals matter!)
2. **No repetition**: Single source of truth
3. **Question everything**: Don't copy blindly
4. **Generic over semantic**: Everything reusable

Next session should continue documenting the remaining systems and concepts before moving to implementation. The user will lead each step - don't rush ahead!
