# 📝 Session Log 002: ONEstore Creation & Systems Audit

**Date**: 2025-01-16  
**Session Focus**: Created ONEstore, audited core systems, established roadmaps  
**Key Achievement**: Clean foundation with working store connection

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

Started building ONE project from scratch based on lessons learned from OOPS. Created minimal ONEstore with TypeScript, tested connection, and audited key systems to plan implementation approach.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. **Repository & Documentation Setup**
- Created local git repository
- Set up GitHub remote: https://github.com/ShannaKaeM/one.git
- Added critical agent rules to roadmap:
  - NO hardcoding without permission
  - CSS Grid ONLY (never flexbox)
  - Always ask before code changes

### 2. **Utilities Documentation**
- Comprehensive audit of OOPS utils folder
- Found 11 files (1,749 lines total)
- Identified:
  - 6 utilities to keep (autoIdHelper, componentRegistry, etc.)
  - 4 to delete (marked for deletion but still exist)
  - 1 new utility not in original audit (processThemeStructure)
  - 1 missing utility found in backup (iconGenerators)
- Created `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/SYSTEMS/Utilities.md`

### 3. **Feature Documentation**
- **Loop/LoopItem Pattern**: Universal "WordPress Loop" for UI
  - Documented innovation from logs 021-022
  - Replaces LayoutSwitcher, CanvasControls with generic pattern
  - 70% code reduction potential
  
- **Auto Grid System**: Pure CSS Grid with a-z areas
  - Automatic grid area assignment
  - NO flexbox rule enforced
  - Visual layout design in grid templates
  - 50% less layout code

### 4. **Roadmap Simplification**
- Created simplified `ONEnew-roadmap.md` 
- Removed timelines and metrics (user has ADHD)
- Consolidated to 4 simple steps
- Moved to `/docs/01-GUIDES/` for easy access
- Added cleanup todos for test code

### 5. **ONEstore Implementation** ✅
```typescript
// Created minimal store with:
- 3 Actors pattern (Designer, Workspace, Projects)
- Full TypeScript types
- Zustand devtools
- Direct action methods
- No events, no props
```
- Located at `/src/stores/ONEstore.ts`
- Created planning doc with all state requirements

### 6. **App.tsx Setup** ✅
- Minimal test implementation (45 lines)
- CSS Grid layout (no flexbox!)
- Store connection verified and working
- Test UI shows store data and toggles work
- Created `App-RM.md` roadmap combining all App docs

### 7. **System Setup Documentation**
- Created `SYSTEMS-roadmap.md` with:
  - Current stack (Vite, React 19, TypeScript, Zustand 5)
  - How to start dev server (`npm run dev`)
  - What we have vs OOPS
  - Dependencies to add as needed

### 8. **ONEconnect Audit**
- Discovered OOPS version is broken!
  - Missing critical StoreConnector file
  - OneConnect.tsx is just placeholder
  - System non-functional
- Documented all findings in `ONEconnect-RM.md`
- Decision: Build from scratch, start minimal
- Identified duplicate systems to avoid

---

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### 1. **OOPS Issues Confirmed**
- Multiple ID generation systems
- Duplicate component registration methods
- Several layout systems doing same thing
- ONEconnect broken with missing files
- Hardcoded values throughout

### 2. **Clean Architecture Emerging**
- ONE store with 3 actors working well
- Simple is better - start minimal
- Grid-only approach is cleaner
- Direct store access eliminates complexity

### 3. **Naming Clarifications**
- ONEstore (not oneStore)
- ONEconnect (not ONE-CONNECT)
- selectedElement (singular, not plural)
- currentView (instead of activeLayout - PTSD)

---

## 📋 Current State

### What's Working
- Git repo setup with GitHub
- ONEstore created and connected
- App.tsx minimal version running
- Dev server working (`npm run dev`)
- Documentation structure established

### Project Structure
```
ONE/
├── src/
│   ├── stores/
│   │   └── ONEstore.ts ✅
│   ├── App.tsx ✅ (test version)
│   ├── App.css (test styles - remove later)
│   └── index.css ✅ (global resets - keep)
└── docs/
    ├── 01-GUIDES/
    │   └── ONEnew-roadmap.md ✅
    ├── 02-ROADMAPS/
    │   ├── COMPONENTS/
    │   ├── FEATURES/
    │   └── SYSTEMS/
    └── 05-LOGS/
```

### Test Code to Remove Later
- `/src/App.tsx` - Replace with real implementation
- `/src/App.css` - Replace with theme styles
- Keep `/src/index.css` - Just global resets

---

## 📊 Decisions Made

1. **Build ONEconnect from scratch** - OOPS version too broken
2. **Start minimal, add as needed** - Avoid complexity
3. **One way to do each thing** - No duplicate systems
4. **CSS Grid only** - No flexbox anywhere
5. **Test before adding** - Evaluate each feature

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Step 2: Core Systems)
1. **Auto Grid Utility**
   - Port getGridArea() function
   - Implement a-z assignment
   - Test with components

2. **Theme Processor**
   - Port runtimeThemeProcessor
   - JSON to CSS conversion
   - Grid layout from theme

3. **Minimal ONEconnect**
   - Start with bare minimum
   - Just render one component
   - Add features as needed

### After Core Systems (Step 3)
- Loop & LoopItem components
- Icon component
- Test with layout switcher

## 📝 Agent Handoff Notes

### Critical Context
1. **User has ADHD/Dyslexia** - Keep things simple, visual, no timelines
2. **Building from scratch** - Don't copy OOPS blindly
3. **OOPS is broken** - ONEconnect missing files, use for reference only
4. **Test code exists** - App.tsx/App.css are temporary, will be replaced

### Important Files
- **Main Roadmap**: `/docs/01-GUIDES/ONEnew-roadmap.md`
- **Component Docs**: `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/COMPONENTS/`
- **System Roadmaps**: `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/SYSTEMS/`
- **Feature Docs**: `/docs/02-ROADMAPS/FEATURES/`

### Rules to Follow
1. ASK FIRST before code changes
2. NO HARDCODING without permission
3. CSS GRID ONLY - never flexbox
4. Keep docs simple - no fluff
5. User likes ALL CAPS for folders
6. DELETE don't comment out code

### Current Status
- Step 1 ✅ Complete (Foundation)
- Step 2 🔄 Ready to start (Core Systems)
- ONEstore working
- App.tsx has test UI (temporary)

### What NOT to Do
- Don't copy broken OOPS code
- Don't add complexity early
- Don't create duplicate systems
- Don't use flexbox
- Don't hardcode values

### Recommended Next Action
Start with Auto Grid utility - it's simple and well-defined:
1. Create `/src/utils/` folder
2. Add getGridArea() function
3. Test with simple example
4. Move to theme processor next

---

## 🎉 Session Summary

Successfully created clean foundation for ONE project:
- Working store with TypeScript
- Clear documentation structure  
- Identified what to build vs avoid
- Simple roadmap without complexity

Ready for next agent to build core systems! The path is clear and the foundation is solid.
