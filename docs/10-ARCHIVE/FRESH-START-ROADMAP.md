# Fresh Start Roadmap: Building Studio1 Right

**Goal**: Build Studio1 from scratch with proper architecture, incorporating all innovations from OOPS

---

## üìÅ Important Resources

### Pre-STORS Project (Original)
- **Path**: `/Users/shannamiddleton/Local Drive Mac/mi agency/miApps/studio1/docs`
- **Key docs**: Original implementation, base elements, architecture patterns

### Post-STORS Project (With Zustand)
- **Path**: `/Users/shannamiddleton/Local Drive Mac/mi agency/miApps/OOPS-STORS/docs`
- **Key docs**: Store refactors, ONE-CONNECT implementation, component migrations

### Current Project (Fresh Start)
- **Path**: `/Users/shannamiddleton/Local Drive Mac/mi agency/miApps/ONE/docs`
- **Key docs**: This roadmap, innovations guide, clean implementation

---

## üö® IMPORTANT RULES FOR AGENTS

1. **Keep docs simple** - No fluff, no metrics, no walls of text
2. **Get permission before changing code** - ALWAYS ask first  
3. **Follow the user's lead** - Give quick high-level answers first, wait for them to ask for more details
4. **ASK for names** - ALWAYS ask what to name files, folders, stores, etc. User likes ALL CAPS for folders
5. **DELETE don't comment** - When removing code, DELETE it completely. Don't leave commented code

---

## üéØ Vision

Build a clean, modular Studio1 with:
- Single unified store (1store)
- ONE-CONNECT orchestration
- Universal Bento Grid (a-z)
- Zero-event architecture
- Modular components
- Theme-driven everything

---

## üìã Phase 1: Project Setup

### 1.1 Create Fresh Project
- [ ] **ASK USER**: What to name the new project folder?
- [ ] Create new Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [ ] **ASK USER**: Folder structure preferences (ALL CAPS?)
- [ ] Set up initial directory structure

### 1.2 Dependencies
- [ ] Zustand for state management
- [ ] TypeScript configured properly
- [ ] **ASK USER**: Any other core dependencies?

### 1.3 Core Folders
- [ ] `/src/COMPONENTS/` - Modular components
- [ ] `/src/STORES/` - 1store location
- [ ] `/src/SYSTEMS/` - ONE-CONNECT, theme processor
- [ ] `/src/UTILS/` - Shared utilities
- [ ] **ASK USER**: Confirm folder names and structure

---

## üîç Component Analysis & Store Planning

### Review Process (Do This First!)
Before creating ONEstore, for each component:
1. **Check both projects**: What worked? What didn't?
2. **Identify state needs**: What data does it actually need?
3. **Question everything**: Is this the right approach?
4. **Plan connections**: How will it connect to other components?

### Component Review Checklist
- [ ] **Icon**: Simple display, preset-driven
- [ ] **IconBar**: Container for icons, layout patterns
- [ ] **Sidebar**: Grid area container
- [ ] **Header**: Composable title/actions
- [ ] **Accordion**: Expand/collapse state
- [ ] **InputBar**: Form input patterns
- [ ] **Canvas**: Selection, elements, tools
- [ ] **Library**: Items, filters, drag source
- [ ] **LayerTree**: Hierarchy, selection sync
- [ ] **LayoutSwitcher**: View modes

### Store Planning Questions
- What state is truly shared vs local?
- What naming makes sense (not "activeLayout" PTSD)?
- What can be derived vs stored?
- What belongs in each actor (Designer/Workspace/Projects)?

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: Core Systems

### 2.1 Create ONEstore
- [ ] **ASK USER**: Confirm name "ONEstore.ts"?
- [ ] Implement 3 actors structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    designer: { /* user actions */ },
    workspace: { /* UI state */ },
    projects: { /* data */ }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add TypeScript types
- [ ] Add devtools support

### 2.2 ONE-CONNECT System
- [ ] **ASK USER**: Keep name "ONE-CONNECT" or prefer different?
- [ ] Port core orchestration logic from OOPS
- [ ] Update to work with 1store
- [ ] Create clean types/interfaces

### 2.3 Theme System
- [ ] Runtime theme processor
- [ ] Pure JSON ‚Üí CSS generation
- [ ] Support for both UI and ONE themes
- [ ] Bento grid areas (a-z)

### 2.4 Component Registry
- [ ] Simple registration system
- [ ] Support for data-component mapping
- [ ] Preset target system
