# ONE Project - Simple Roadmap

**What we're building**: Clean version of Studio1 with all the good stuff from OOPS

---

## Important Stuff to Remember

1. **Documentation is done** - We analyzed all major components
2. **We know the patterns** - Loop/LoopItem, Auto Grid, ONEconnect
3. **Start simple** - Get basics working, add features as we go
4. **You lead** - I follow your direction

---

## Big Picture Steps

### 1. Get ONE working
- ✅ Project created (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- ✅ Git repo setup
- [ ] Create ONEstore (the main store)
- [ ] Hook it up to App.tsx

### 2. Port the cool systems
- [ ] ONEconnect (auto component wiring)
- [ ] Auto Grid (a-z magic)
- [ ] Theme processor (JSON → CSS)

### 3. Build components (start simple)
- [ ] Loop & LoopItem (replaces lots of stuff)
- [ ] Basic components that use ONEstore
- [ ] Test as we go

### 4. Add features when ready
- [ ] Whatever you need next
- [ ] We'll figure it out together
